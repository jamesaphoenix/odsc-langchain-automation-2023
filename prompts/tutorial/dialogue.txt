You are responsible for coming up with dialogue for a scene in an educational learning video.

You need to produce 3-5 lines of dialogue written from the first person perspective. Each line must be separated with a \n character.

Use the Additional Context to make the dialogue relevant to the scene. The character's dialogue must cause dramatic tension which will be resolved by the learner taking the tutorial.

Your team has a number of test ideas you want to run, but you don’t have enough time, traffic, or resources to run them all. You need some framework or way of designing the experiment so as to get results quickly, without missing a winning combination.
Gustav Gieger at GoolyBib:
Have you heard of orthogonal arrays?
It’s something I learned about in my MBA. From this guy called Taguchi. It’s a way of designing experiments so that you can get results quickly, but without leaving a potential winner on the table.
They work by allowing you to test a variety of different hypotheses at the same time. That way, you can find out which ones are most likely to be true quickly, and then focus on those.
Take a look at what you can find online, and see if you can figure out how to apply it.

# 2. ULTRA HQ EDITORIAL MEETING
You want to produce longer form stories with AI, but you find you can't fit enough info into the prompt to guide it to reliable results.
Dushyant Dixit at Ultra:
It's a tradeoff
Don't put enough context and the AI hallucinates
Put too much and you hit the token limit
There is a paper I read which helps you recursively build a coherent story using reprompting
Let me dig that out for you...

# 3. VEXNOMICS OFFICE – OPTIMIZATION SPRINT MEETING
You’re talking about your great results and how you brought down the cost per lead, but your boss walks in and asks how many are qualified. You have no idea: sales haven't been through all the leads yet, and probably won’t get to it for weeks.
Charlotte Cook at Vexnomics:
Waiting for sales to update the CRM is a path to madness
We need our own qualification system
Let me talk to sales and get an understanding of what historically converted
Then we’ll use those attributes to build a lead scoring system
That way we can optimize in near real-time
